This folder contains solutions to Leetcode I have solved so far.
Each solution correspond to a leet code problem. The link to the Leetcode question is present as a comment in the top of their respective main.c file.

The name of folders ex. sol_2, sol_10 etc. correspond to each question in [this sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1sSVEaSVjN1lnAuPmbg_UUm-7cU81U8it_z57M96ib2o/edit?usp=sharing).

I found this sheet on a twitter post. Don't have the twitter post link with me.

**Dinesh Varyani** is the person who compiled this list and also has a Youtube channel: https://www.youtube.com/user/hubberspot.

So shout out to him for providing this great material for learning.

The solutions may not run as is, I compiled it locally, copy pasted in Leet code and then did some changes for it to be able to run on Leetcode. So you may have to do the same.
